SELECTING THE CORRECT TEMPLATE
------------------------------

The files represent the two most common resolution ratios – 4:3 and 16:9 – pick
the one that matches the resolution ratio of the projecting machine.


ADDING FOOTER INFORMATION
-------------------------

The footer is half-automated; you only need to insert your information once to
show them on all slides.

	To do this, go to Insert -> Header and Footer...


CUSTOM BACKGROUNDS FOR SLIDES
-----------------------------

The regular page template footer has a normally invisible white background;
this allows you to use custom backgrounds for slides without extra work.

    To do this, go to Slide -> Set Background Image...

The image is autofitted on the background, so if the source isn't in the same
ratio as the slideshow, you will have to manually adjust the appearance.

    To do this, go to Slide -> Slide Properties...

In this dialog, uncheck AutoFit, and adjust the Size parameters to get the image
show in the desired ratio. For best results, use the Relative sizes with the
Width set at 100%.


REMOVE A BACKGROUND FROM A SLIDE
--------------------------------

Sometimes you might want to remove the mouse background from a slide.

    To do this, uncheck Slide -> Display Master Background
